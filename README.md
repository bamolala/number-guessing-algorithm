I initialised a attempt variable equal 0

The program starts by generating a random number between 1 and 10. A loop then begins, allowing the user to keep guessing until they get the correct number.

Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter their guess. The program checks the guess against the randomly generated number and the attempt variable increments by 1:

I set the maximum attempts equals 2, if exceeded, the loop breaks and it tells the user that they have used up their number of attempts.

* **If** the guess is equal to the random number, the program displays a congratulatory message and ends.
* **If** the guess is not an integer, the program tell the user to pass in an integer between 1 and 10.
* **If** the guess is greater than the random number, it tells the user their guess is too high and asks them to try again.
* **If** the guess is less than the random number, it tells the user their guess is too low and asks them to try again.
* **If** the guess is outside the valid range (less than 1 or greater than 10), the program reminds the user to pick a number between 1 and 10.
